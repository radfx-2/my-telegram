# Telegram-API-Info-Extractor

#Description:
This repository contains a Python script that helps you extract your api_id and api_hash from Telegram, which are necessary for interacting with the Telegram API using the Telethon or Pyrogram libraries.

To use Telegram's API in a Python project, you'll need an api_id and api_hash, which you can obtain by registering your application on the Telegram website. This script guides you through the process of obtaining those credentials
